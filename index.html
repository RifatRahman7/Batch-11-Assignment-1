                    "I believe we can create a world where poverty no longer exists, where the resources of the world
                    are used to benefit people rather than to exploit them, and where the well-being of people becomes
                    the purpose of business, not just profit. Bangladesh has proven that it is possible to create a
                    society that is both economically sustainable and socially inclusive. The concept of social business
                    is a step toward a world where people’s needs and aspirations are met by the systems that serve
                    them, not by creating more inequality and suffering. We need to create new ways of thinking, and new
                    systems that will replace the old ones. We must be able to think beyond profit and understand that
                    human happiness and fulfillment must take precedence over material gain."

                                Pollution can take many forms, including air pollution, water pollution, soil
                                contamination, and noise pollution, all of which have devastating consequences for both

                                actions that individuals, businesses, and governments can take to combat pollution and
                                work towards a cleaner, healthier environment.</p>
